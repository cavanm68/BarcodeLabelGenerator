An open-source, browser-based barcode SKU label generator built with JavaScript (frontend) and Python Flask (backend). Supports QR/Code128, manual or RNG SKU entry, and precise layout control.

Originally built for eBay inventory and ecommerce workflows, **SkuLabelGenerator** gives you the ability to generate or import large amounts of store SKUs or any similar strings for that matter. The program is quite flexible which opens it up to much broader uses in addition to tracking items.
